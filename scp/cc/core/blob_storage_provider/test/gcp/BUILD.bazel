# This manual test runs against a prod instance of Cloud Storage
# The bucket is automatically created and destroyed within the provided
# project. Make sure the bucket name does not clash with any bucket
# you care about.
#
# To run against a prod instance of Cloud Storage, you need to use a service
# account. To do so, create a key for the account and export the variable path
# to it with `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/key.json`
# The key can be created by following:
# https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating
#
# This test should be called via similar:
# `cc_test "cc/core/blob_storage_provider/test/gcp:gcp_cloud_storage_async_test \
#   --test_env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"`
