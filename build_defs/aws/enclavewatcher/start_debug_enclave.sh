# Script to help debug worker errors by starting a new enclave process in debug
# mode (note: preventing binary attestation) and immediately attaching a
# console. To be used manually.
#
# Useful for debugging the enclave when it fails to fully initialize and is in a
# flapping state (being restarted by systemd) by attaching a console immediately
# after starting the worker.
#
# Assumes at most one enclave is running on the system. Stops the enclave watcher
# process if it is running and does not restart it automatically.
