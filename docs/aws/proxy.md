# Overview

This utility is a C++ based proxy for supporting network traffic on AWS Nitro Enclaves. It speaks
mostly the [SOCKS5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1928) protocol.

# How it works

The basic concept behind this proxy is using LD_PRELOAD library to override a few libc functions,
and convert those calls into SOCK5 calls to the proxy. The current list of overridden symbols are
listed as below:

-   accept
-   accept4
-   bind
-   connect
-   epoll_add
-   getsockopt
-   ioctl
-   listen
-   setsockopt

On outgoing connection, all traffic starts with `connect()` call. When a TCP socket is created via
`socket()`, namely a `AF_INET`/`AF_INET6` socket with `SOCK_STEAM` type, we forcibly make it
`AF_VSOCK`. SOCKS5 handshake is performed inside `connect()` before it returns.

With regards to incoming connections, for security reasons, we do not listen on VSOCK port inside
the enclave. Instead, we connect out to the proxy to establish a pool of standby connections. Upon
each new incoming connection, one standby connection from the pool is chosen to forward traffic to.
Since we cannot maintain the pool within the application process itself (as it needs extra threads,
etc, to maintain the state, which do not work with fork; and it will also not work with
select/poll/epoll), we created socket_vendor to manage the pools. The application talks to
socket_vendor on bind/listen/accept over unix domain socket.

# What works and what does not

Any application that dynamically links libc to do syscalls will work. This includes C/C++ based
applications, rust, CPython, and Java, etc.

Application that statically links libc, or uses its own syscall implementation, won't work. This
likely includes golang. A future improvement may be using eBPF inside the enclave if possible, to
replace the LD_PRELOAD libs.

The LD_PRELOAD library currently keeps no internal state of each socket. It functions by looking at
the type and domain of each socket. This means, if you call getsockname/getpeername after connection
establishment, you'll probably get some garbage.

# Build

## Building the proxy

```shell
    scripts/build-proxy
```

## Building and running tests

```shell
    bazel test //src/aws/proxy/...
```

# Other useful tips

## Running your own application

If you'd like to try out this proxy with your own application, follow these steps:

1. Use `scripts/build-proxy` to build proxy.
1. Look for `dist/aws/proxy-al2-amd64.zip`, unzip and upload it to your EC2 instance.
1. Run proxy in background on the EC2 instance.
1. (Optional) Run `//src/aws/proxy:copy_to_dist` and upload
   `dist/aws/resolv_conf_getter_server_debian_image.tar` to your EC2 instance.
1. (Optional) Run the `resolv_conf_getter` server in the background.

```shell
docker load -i resolv_conf_getter_server_debian_image.tar
docker run -d -p 1600:1600 bazel/src/aws/proxy:resolv_conf_getter_server_debian_image
```

1. Add the `//src/aws/proxy:proxify_layer` layer to the definition of your image.
1. Put CMD as `["/path/to/proxify", "--", "your_app", "one_arg", "more_args"]`.
1. Build and run the enclave image.

## Notes

1. **Currently we only support TCP**. UDP is not supported at the moment. DNS lookups that goes
   through UDP won't work. We uses 'use-vc' option in resolv.conf to make DNS lookup to go through
   TCP as well.
1. In nitro enclaves, `/etc/resolv.conf` is likely to be a dangling symlink. `proxify` by default
   unlinks it and creates a new one with pre-defined content that defines the nameservers to 8.8.8.8
   and 1.1.1.1. This will make the enclave application talk to these servers during DNS resolution.
   It may not work in a private VPC without internet access. You may need to override the
   `/etc/resolv.conf` inside the enclave with your desired private DNS settings. To use the host DNS
   settings within the enclave, run `/proxify /resolv_conf_getter_client` inside the enclave after
   performing the optional steps in the [previous section](#running-your-own-application).
1. AmazonLinux2 (AL2) uses an old version of glibc. Newer compilers with newer glibc on your build
   machine may generate binary that's not runnable on AL2. That's why we created
   `//src/aws/proxy:reproducible_proxy_outputs` target to generate binaries that's guaranteed
   runnable on AL2. It also makes the build reproducible for building enclave images.
